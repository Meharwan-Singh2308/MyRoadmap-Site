MyRoadmap is a simple and effective tool designed for 11th-grade physics students preparing for the JEE/NEET exams. It provides a well-structured roadmap of the 11th-grade physics syllabus, allowing students to track their progress by checking off topics as they study. The application saves this progress data locally on their device, ensuring that students can continue where they left off.

## Features

- **Progress Tracking**: Checkboxes next to each topic allow students to mark topics as completed.
- **Local Data Storage**: Progress is saved locally on the device, so students can access and update their roadmap offline.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design focused on functionality and ease of use.
